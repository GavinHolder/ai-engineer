i need your help, im starting my software company, that said it would be me and you doing the work, but you would have a bigger role, you would be my engineer, creative director and web designer, my latest ─
  bootstrap framework guru and code prodigy, that said i need you to pls help me get your function streamlined, i need you to create me python script that would setup my Django/python or react/next.js -> running on Vite  server projects ( so i should be prompted which one i would use ) I would need a git repo to download and closne to start the process going forward, bbut all the plugins md fiels and sopesific claude.md files and so on must be cloned and then the script to install all the pluigns and ghet the specific system up n running, if the user iuses a like pycharm or websiotorm which has these predefined framework selections done then ther iuser can just runn  the smikled down scriopt I need you to create to only do the plugin installation and the claude code optimized, from then onwards I need to follow a very strickt workflow, 1) plan mode with opus latest model alwatays yto plan the project, scale deployment  ( which will always be a docker solution with porrtainer, portainer being ints won stack, and traefik being itas own stack and the the apps will alos be their own stack, but apps ill ALWAYS manulayy build via portainer, no app we develop will be anuyto buiold portainer will always be wthe workflow, so docker compose files must alays have a image build structure not a anutomatic buid json, also always have local vm mounted fodders to access the containers )  I will be using a custom inhouse program called WebAppManager in folder K:\2025\WebAppManager that will be used to manage all the applications once deplouyed
what I need you to do I go through my SSD K:\ als explore all my projects I have also my F:\Projects to get a VERY good understanding of my UI preferenecs and my backend logic and nuances on my code preferenecs, it would give you a VERY good understanding of my programming character, preferences and so on
then I will need you to create me script to ruyn that would aks for descriptons of the projects, any client docs of required functionality and app direction etc, then asking front end questions like backend needs, front end needs, API etc to gather a good understanding, then I need you to always create the logic in manaagebe code line optimize ways, functions in their own py files, models seerate to spread the load to not have 1000k liners of code files, follow SPA (single Page Application guide lines ) and not templates all over, use partial html inhectiuon with HTMX ( if not using react for example ), single page application design methodology is at the fore front of my design preference, I don’t care for 100;’s of py files each having a function and related linking logic  but HTML templates and css myst be proper and intelligently constructed to be minbilal and make use od partial html template injection witgh context spesifci info
